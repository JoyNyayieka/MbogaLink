##  Project Overview

This project is a Django-based e-commerce platform tailored for small-scale fresh produce vendors. It enables vendors to list their products, manage inventory, and receive payments, while customers can browse nearby vendors, view fresh produce, and place orders. 

The platform is optimized for accessibility and ease of use, especially for users with limited technical expertise, and it aims to bridge the digital gap in informal markets by offering a lightweight, mobile-friendly solution.
